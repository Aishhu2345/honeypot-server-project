## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project involves deploying an SSH honeypot server using Cowrie to detect and analyze real-world attack patterns.

Cowrie was installed on a Linux system and configured to simulate a vulnerable SSH service. The honeypot captured unauthorized connection attempts, brute-force login attempts, and attacker commands. Logs were analyzed to identify attack trends and behaviors.
